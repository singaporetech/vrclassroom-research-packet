# immersification-vr-classroom

## What is this?
This is the place to version-control all files related to the VR Classroom project under the Centre for Immersification and CoLEAD at SIT.
The work packages required will be managed under Projects in a running [Kanban board](https://github.com/singaporetech/immersification-vr-classroom/projects/1).

## Development Process
This project is in its starting phases and we will follow a fluid Kanban approach with a single continuous flow of tasks from TODO --> IN-PROGRESS --> DONE .
